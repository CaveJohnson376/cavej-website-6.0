# CaveJ376's website 6.0-beta
complete rewrite of my website in python, without using frameworks. why? for fun and giggles.
also doubles as my custom framework you can use for your own websites. two ducks with single shot!

currently includes:
+ page compose engine - slaps content with title onto pre-made page with footer and header.
+ simple article engine - yet to be completely done.
+ main page - shows up 10 recent articles, yet to show other stuff.

TODO:
- normal page system. those good ol' pages without specific author and publication time, but title and content.
- creation/portfolio page system. somewhat like articles, but for art and stuff i do.
- quotebook page system. finally, worthy quotebook.
- discord login.
- proper website design. i suck at web design.
- comment system.
- CaveBot (a bot by @Apceniy) and Caroline (my yet-to-be-made assistant bot) integration
- possibly other stuff

how to run:
1. clone repo
2. change .html and .json files as you wish
3. run main.py using python 3.10 or newer
4. connect to machine wherever you run this to port 46667 using almost any web browser of your choice(can be changed on last line of main.py)
