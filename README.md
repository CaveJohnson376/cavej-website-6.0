# CaveJ376's website 6.0-beta
complete rewrite of my website in python, without using frameworks. why? for fun and giggles.

currently includes:
+ page compose engine - slaps content with title onto pre-made page with footer and header.
+ simple article engine - yet to be completely done.
+ main page - shows up 10 recent articles, yet to show other stuff.

TODO:
- normal page system. those good ol' pages without specific author and publication time, but title and content.
- creation/portfolio page system. somewhat like articles, but for art and stuff i do.
- quotebook page system. finally, worthy quotebook.
- discord login.
- proper website design. i suck at web design.
- comment system.
- CaveBot (a bot by @Apceniy) and Caroline (my yet-to-be-made assistant bot) integration
- possibly other stuff
